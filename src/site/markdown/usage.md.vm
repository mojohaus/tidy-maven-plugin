Usage
=====

The following examples describe the basic usage of the Tidy Plugin.

Format the POM
--------------

To format the `pom.xml` execute the `pom` goal manually.

    mvn tidy:pom

The `pom.xml` file will

* be rewritten according to the
[POM Code Convention](http://maven.apache.org/developers/conventions/code.html#POM_Code_Convention)
of the Maven team.
* have the nodes `groupId`, `artifactId` and `version` always in this order.

Note: It is recommended that you use your IDE or other formatting tools to
ensure that your `pom.xml` is indented correctly.

Note: The following sections can have their child elements reordered without affecting the build:

* `/project/licenses`
* `/project/developers`
* `/project/contributors`
* `/project/mailingLists`
* `/project/properties`
* `/project/build/pluginManagement/plugins`
* `/project/profiles`

Note: The following sections potentially can affect the build process if the child elements are reordered:

* `/project/repositories`
* `/project/pluginRepositories`
* `/project/dependencyManagement/dependencies`
* `/project/dependencies`
* `/project/build/plugins`

Checking for Tidy POM as Part of the Build
------------------------------------------

If you want to fail the build for a POM that is not formatted according to the
`pom` goal, you must add an execution of `tidy:check` to the `build` element.

    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
      <artifactId>tidy-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>${project.version}</version>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <id>validate</id>
          <phase>validate</phase>
          <goals>
            <goal>check</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
