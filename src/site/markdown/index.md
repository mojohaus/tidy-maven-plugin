Tidy Maven Plugin
=================

The Tidy Plugin tidies up a project's `pom.xml` and optionally verifies
that it is tidy.

Goals Overview
--------------

The Tidy Plugin has two goals.

* [tidy:pom](./pom-mojo.html) tidies up the project's `pom.xml`.
* [tidy:check](./check-mojo.html) checks that the project's `pom.xml` is tidy.

Usage
-----

General instructions on how to use the different goals of the Tidy Plugin can
be found on the [usage page](./usage.html).

To tidy up the `pom.xml`, simply invoke it on your project, e.g.

        mvn tidy:pom

The `pom.xml` file will

* be rewritten according to the
  [POM Code Convention](http://maven.apache.org/developers/conventions/code.html#POM_Code_Convention)
  of the Maven team.
* have the nodes `groupId`, `artifactId` and `version` always in this order.
